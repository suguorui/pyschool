#Write a function calCumulativeSum(numbers) that 
#takes in a list of numbers as argument and returns 
#the cumulative sum of the list. That is, the new list 
#where the i element is the sum of the first i + 1 elements 
#from the original list. For example, the cumulative sum of [1, 2, 3] is [1, 3, 6].

	cumsum = 0
	result = []
	for x in numbers:
		cumsum += x
		result.append(cumsum)
	return result
