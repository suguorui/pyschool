class Point:
      "A class implementation of 2-Dimensional point."

#It is possible to change the behaviour of built-in opertators 
#with special methtods. For example, the '+' operator can be 
#implemented with the __add__ method. Define a Point class that 
#supports operator overloading for the '+' and '-' operators.
#As supposed to concencating 

#>>> a = Point(1,3)     
#    >>> b = Point(7,2)     
#    >>> print a+b
#    '(8, 5)'
#    >>> print a-b
#    '(-6, 1)'
