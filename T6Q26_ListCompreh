#List comprehension offers a concise way to derive a new list
#from an existing list or sequence. Given a list of numbers, 
#write a function that returns the numbers that are greater than the average.


def getAboveAverage(nums):
    return [ x for x in nums if x > (sum(nums)/len(nums))]  # complete the list comprehension
