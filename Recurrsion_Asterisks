# You can use this code segment as template or rewrite everything on your own
# Write a function createPattern(n) that takes in a number as argument and returns a string based on the following #rules. The middle character of the string should always be an asterisk ('*'). There will be 2 asterisks if there #is an even number of characters. The string will contain the less-than character ('<') before the asterisk and the #greater-than character ('>') after the asterisk.



def createPattern(x):
    if x == 0:
        return ''
    if x == 1:
        return '*'
    if x == 2:
        return '**'
    else:
        return '<'+createPattern(x-2)+'>'
