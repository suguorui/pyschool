# The Pascal's Triangle is formed by filling the top 2 rows with '1's. 
# For subsequent row, the numbers at the edge are all '1's. 
# Each element inside the triangle is the sum of the 2 elements above it. 
#Write a recursive function to compute the value of each element given the row and column.

# Note: Row and column are counting from 0, i.e. coordinates of top element is (0, 0).
