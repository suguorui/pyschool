#Write a function printTwos(n) that takes in a number as argument and 
#returns a string composed of an odd number multiplied by 2s such that 
#the final value is equal to n. There should be equal number of 2s on 
#both sides. Extra 2 should appear at the front of the string. 
#Note: The value of the odd number can be 1.
